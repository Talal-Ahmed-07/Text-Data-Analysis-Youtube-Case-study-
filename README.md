# Text-Data-Analysis-Youtube-Case-study-

### Project Overview
- This project aims to deliver meaningful findings into how YouTube data is distributed among different categories, dependent on viewer response such as likes, dislikes, emojis and comments.
- I have also performed sentiment analysis using comments to see which words are mostly used in both the negative and positive sense by the viewers.
- Last, but not the least, I have analyzed comments to see how punctuation is effecting useful metrics i-e likes and dislikes.
