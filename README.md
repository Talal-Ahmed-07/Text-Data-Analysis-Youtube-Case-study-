# Text Data Analysis - Youtube Case Study

### Project Overview
- This project aims to deliver meaningful findings into how YouTube data is distributed among different categories, dependent on viewer response such as likes, dislikes, emojis and comments.
- I have also performed sentiment analysis using comments to see which words are mostly used in both the negative and positive sense by the viewers.
- Last, but not the least, I have analyzed comments to see how punctuation is effecting useful metrics i-e likes and dislikes.

### Data Source
- All the data is collected from Youtube, in the form of a csv file, containing columns like comment, likes, replies and more than 50 k rows of data.
- Additional data is also collected, including various csv files, and each contains data with respect to various metrics based on a specific region like Canada, Russia, USA etc.
